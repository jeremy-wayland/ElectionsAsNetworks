    "## Background Theory\n",
    "Here I will summarize the formalism used/developed in Wayland2019. The construction of a generalized voting system, consisting of a set of voters, a set of candidates and a voting rule to compute the outcome of an election is quite standard in the field of social choice theory.\n",
    "* Let $V$ be a nonempty set of n voters $\\{1,...,n\\}$\n",
    "* Let $C$ be the set of m candidates $\\{c_1,...,c_m\\}$\n",
    "* In this situation, we assume that each voter is ranking each of the candidates on their ballot to produce a linear order.\n",
    "* Let $\\mathcal{L}(C)$ denote the set of all linear orders on $C$. It follows then that the collection of ballots, which will be referred to as a profile $\\mathbb{P}$, is a subset of $\\mathcal{L}(C)$. \n",
    "* For $i\\in V$ let $P_i\\in \\mathcal{L}(C)$ denote the truthful preferences of the $i^{th}$ voter.\n",
    "* Then a voting rule, $f$ is nothing more than a function $f:\\mathcal{L}(C)\\to C$ that picks out a single winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Voting Rules\n",
    "There are a number of different ways to determine the outcome of an election. This investigation will only consider positional scoring rules. These assign a numerical score to each candidate based on their rank in each $P_i$; the candidate with the maximum score is selected as the winner. \n",
    "* Define a scoring vector to be $s = \\langle s_1,s_2,...,s_m \\rangle$ where for $j=1,...,m-1, s_j\\geq s_{j+1}$.\n",
    "* For $x\\in C$, let the function $score(P_i,x) = s_r$. This picks out the appropriate score in the scoring vector assocaited with the $r^{th}$ element in the linear order $P_i$.\n",
    "* Thus in collecting the total score for $x\\in C$ we are computing $total(\\mathbb{P},x) = \\sum_{i=1}^n score(P_i,x)$\n",
    "* This allows for a concrete definition of a voting rule $f$ on a given profile $\\mathbb{P}$ and scoring vector $s$:\n",
    "    $$ f(\\mathbb{P},s) = \\max_{x\\in C} total(\\mathbb{P},x)$$\n",
    "##### This formalism allows you to fully generate a postional scoring rule given it's scoring vector. Here are some specifications of a few common voting rules:\n",
    "* Plurality: the rule given by $\\langle 1,...,0 \\rangle$.\n",
    "* k-approval: the rule given by $\\langle 1,1,...,0 \\rangle$ where you have $k$ 1's followed by zeros.\n",
    "* Borda: the rule given by $\\langle m-1,m-2,...,0 \\rangle$"
