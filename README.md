# Elections_as_Networks
A class project for CS 510 in the CADS PhD program at Chapman University. The goal will be to implement the action performed when computing the results of an election in a way that is consistent with Network theory and Category theory models of generalized open networks. Details on the goals and background of this project can be found in Wayland2019 and Project_Proposal. Initially this project will simulate a generalized voting system using R. Once a foundational understanding has been achieved from a programming perspective, the implementation can be translated into Haskell which hasd the potential to truly build a model consistent with the underlying category theory.
